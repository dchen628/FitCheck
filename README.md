## Description
FitCheck is a fashion website designed to help people find inspiring outfit ideas based on their activity and preferences. The platform caters to individuals with an interest in exploring new and unique fashion styles, particularly younger generations who are more adventurous and open to experimenting with their clothing choices. The app's core mission is to provide a solution for users who struggle with finding the right style that suits them or knowing what to wear for different occasions.

The Problem: Choosing the perfect outfit can be a challenge for many people. People can find it hard to find a style that fits well unless they see it visually on other people. There is a lack of a unified platform for fashion recommendations that provides a unified user experience.

Our strategy to tackle this problem is create a fashion-focused web application, similar to Pinterest, where users can browse, post, like, and comment on outfit post/inspirations. Through personalized onboarding process, our platform will recommend fits based on user preferences, fostering an engaged and interactive fashion community.

## Usage

Currently, our website is experiencing temporary limitations as we have been unable to find a free platform to host the Express server. As a consequence, only the creators of the website have access to its functionalities. While we are actively working to find a suitable platform to host the Express server, in the meantime, we encourage interested users to reach out to me, or one of our collaborators. We will be more than happy to provide you with a demonstration of the website's functionalities and answer any questions you may have. Thank you for your understanding!
